unlimit [ -hs ] resource ...
       The resource limit for each resource is set to the  hard  limit.
       If  the  -h  flag  is given and the shell has appropriate privi-
       leges, the hard resource limit for  each  resource  is  removed.
       The  resources  of  the shell process are only changed if the -s
       flag is given.
